# Animals

## Simple image gallery:
A small app that must two lists of images. One about cats and the other about dogs. The pictures can be acquired from the following APIs: The Cat API (http://thecatapi.com/) and The Dog API (https://thedogapi.com/). The goal is to create a tabbed app, containing two tabs:

• The first one is a list of 25 random cat pictures (GET cats)
• The second one is a list of 50 random dog pictures. 

When clicking in a image, it should transition into a very simple screen showing the breed information about the the animal. If the image is associated with more than one breed, you can assume the first one as the only one for simplicity. In general dog pictures come with breed information while cat pictures usually don't. If the picture has no breed, you don't have to do nothing.
